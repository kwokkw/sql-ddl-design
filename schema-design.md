Diagram what 
- the tables and 
- relationships should look like as well as 
- some other things you might want to store/potential challenges with the model and/or information you are storing.

  - `player_id` (FK)
  - `team_id` (FK)
  - `start_date`
  - `end_date`

  - `player_id` (PK)
  - `player_name`
  - `team_id` (FK)

- games
  - `game_id`(PK)
  - `referees`
  - `home_team_id` (FK)
  - `away_team_id` (FK)
